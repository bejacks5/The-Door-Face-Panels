Liveness Check and Login/MFA Integration

Overview
The goal of this feature is to add a simple liveness check before a user can log in. After liveness is passed, the script connects to Student 1’s backend and completes the normal login → MFA → session flow.

Files Included
- liveness_module.py
  - Runs a basic text-based liveness check.
  - Prompts the user to type "blink".
  - Returns either LIVENESS_PASSED or FAILED.

⦁	login_with_liveness.py
  - Integrates the liveness check with the backend.
  - Sends a login request to `/login` with `livenessVerified = True`.
  - If MFA is required, it automatically calls `/mfa/verify`.
  - Prints the final session token if authentication succeeds.

Requirements
Backend (Student 1)
The Node.js backend must be running
