# The-Door-Face-Panels

This is the repo for the ASU Door Face Panels Team.

This project aims to design and implement a robust cybersecurity system for smart Door Face
Panels equipped with facial/voice recognition, NFC, and RFID technologies. The system will
provide AI-enabled multi-factor authentication, strong data protection , and compliance with
industry standards while addressing vulnerabilities through risk assessment, encryption, secure
communication, and threat detection. Key outcomes include secure access control, an incident
response plan, regular audits, user training, and alignment with IoT security best practices,
ensuring a scalable and future-proof security framework for the Door Face Panels system.
